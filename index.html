            Step Into FOSSology
          </h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            This article is the beginning of a what could be a series of topics on FOSSology. Hopefully you will like this article.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, I wouldn't say I would be the most qualified person to talk about this, but I would like to possibly share my experience as a License and Compliance Specialist. <br>
          <p>
          <p>
            FOSSology is a simple, user friendly and an efficient open source tool used for open source compliance analysis. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, you probably see a bunch of words up here which might not make any sense,but open source is one of the most talked about subject in the world these days.
          </p>

          <p>
            You ask, what is open source software? <br>

            Well, as it says, a software of which the source code is open and available for free for anyone.

          </p>
          <p>

            Now, what's this business of compliance analysis you say? <br>

            Well I didn't know about compliance analysis either when I first started working.<br>

            So, you might have seen these license agreements when you install software on your laptop which most of you would definitely have ignored and accepted without even bothering to read ;),
          </p>

          <p>

            Now, that is really important given you actually plan on working with that stuff at the code level. <br>

            Now, that I've got all of that out of the way, here's some more information to keep you going with FOSSology.

          </p>

          <p>
            The user interface of the tool is simple for new user to scan and analyse the code. <br>

            It takes the any software package as an input, scans it and gives us a list of open source licenses and copyrights available in the uploaded package. <br>

            It is a tool which is used to scan your code and analyse FOSS licenses and copyrights.
          </p>

          <p>
            FOSS licenses are typically the licenses associated with open source software, some common things you might have heard would be Apache, or GPL and there a ton more of them. <br>

            Now, getting back on topic, what do I usually do after scanning code, it's not that I just take the stuff out and post it saying it's done. If that was the case, probably a anyone could sit behind a screen and just continually hit the submit button. <br>

            So, what needs to happen in real life is that the actual decision making is supposed to done with a sound thought and thorough knowledge of the subject of licenses and so, that is actually done manually.
          </p>

          <p>
            Why do I say this?

            Well there could be a license which is not part of the package but may be mentioned in any documents as an explanation or a smart ass developer might actually remove a comment which ends up as a False positive entry.

          </p>

          <p>
            So, what more does FOSSology do? It also allows the user to go through each and every file of the package, check for the code with highlighting in the license related texts and copyrights.

            With the various filter options, the user can quickly find any file within a package and verify the license within it.

            Why would I verify licenses now?

            Well, when there are restrictive licenses found in the package, the user can quickly check for it and make a decision to proceed using the package in their project.

          </p>

          <p>
            Now, you might be thinking, I thought that licenses were meant to be restrictive, or strict or something of that sort,  but it is not all that simple. You have many different licenses (which I would talk about in upcoming parts of this series)  and these licenses have different levels of restrictions, laws associated with it and a whole lot more. <br>

            When we talk about restrictive licenses, a simple example would be GPL (General Public License)  which in the most simplest sense says that if I were to use the associated software/code in my software/code I would need to give my source code back to the community, and if I were planning to make my source code proprietary or  sell my product for tons of money, then it wouldn't really work for me due to the restrictions of the license. <br>

            And in case I didn't go through the license and haven't realized it at the beginning, spent 100's of hours on the source code  and on the verge of announcing my super software to the world I would have pretty much lost everything that I spent on this piece of code, all because I didn't read the license :(

          </p>
          <p>
            So, now that we know that there are different types of licenses, what do we do?

            What we need to do is that we need to remove all the false positive results which were generated during the verification done during the scan.

            Once you take out all false positive results from the tool and manual analysis of the licenses you can generate a report which gives you details of license text, file list, copyrights etc which you need, to fulfill the obligations.

          </p>
          <p>
            So, what are the advantages that I have found to be from using FOSSology?
            <li>
              Open source tool hence it is free of cost and modified/customized according to the your usage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Easy to use.
            </li>
            <li>
              Efficient because it traverse over every file in the package, not only over the documents.
            </li>
            <li>
              Can be combined with other tools.
            </li>
            <li>
              Handles most file patterns.
            </li>
          </p>

          <p>
            But what I have found to be difficult so far,

            It is mostly suitable for pure open source components which means that I can't use it directly with proprietary content. When you upload only binary files it might not be as accurate as in the case of source code.

          </p>
          <p>
            With all that being said, I would urge you all to look and try out this tool and see how it works for you.

            I look forward to writing some more articles on the topic.
